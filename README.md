# cache-me

A file cache manager with streams and promises support.

### Exports:
- *get(name)* -> Promise({ confObj, rstream } or { confObj, rstream, err })
- *getSync(name)* -> Object(confObj)
- *set({ name, data, encoding, file (path= name), time= 1h, relatedData= {}, override= true })* -> Promise(Confirmation message (String) or Error instance)
- *setParallel(see set args)* -> callback(err)
- *hasSync(name)* -> Boolean
- *reset(name)* -> Promise(Confirmation message (String) or Error instance)
- *resetSync(name)* -> Boolean
- *delete(name)* -> Promise(Confirmation message (String) or Error instance)
- *deleteSync(name)* -> Boolean
- *clear()* -> Promise(Confirmation message (String) or Error instance)
- *clearSync()* -> Boolean

### How it works
- stores data in 2 files :
  - a JSON conf file
    {
      name,
      data,
      encoding,
      relatedData,
      file {
        path,
        saved,
        encoding,
      },
      lastModified,
      expires
    },
  - and a file containing data only in order to get a stream from it
- get data synchronously or asynchronously with Promises and Readable stream
- internal 'files' directory must exist or an error will be catched
  -> relatedData could be an object used to build the effective data
    as a javascript object to transform into XML
  -> time are in milliseconds
