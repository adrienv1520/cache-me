# cache-me

A file cache manager with streams and promises support.

### Installation
`npm i -S cache-me`

### How it works
- stores data in 2 files :
  - a JSON conf file with this structure :
    {
      name,
      data,
      encoding,
      relatedData,
      file {
        path,
        saved,
        encoding,
      },
      lastModified,
      expires
    },
  - and a file containing data only in order to get a stream from it
- get data synchronously or asynchronously with Promises and Readable stream
- internal 'files' directory must exist or an error will be thrown
- the *relatedData* option could be an object used to build the effective data as a javascript object to transform into XML format
- time are in milliseconds
- logs are made via the *debug* module to avoid synchronous *console* logs

### How to use it:
```javascript
const cache = require('cache-me');
```

####get(name)
Get the data in cache from the data file as a Readable stream. If the data set is in cache but has expired it will reject with an object and an err.code = 'EXPIRED'. *Asynchronous*

Params:
  - name \<String\>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - Promise:
    - resolve with { confObj <Object>, rstream <Readable Stream> }
    - reject with { err <Error>, confObj <Object>, rstream <Readable Stream> }

Example:
  ```javascript
  cache
    .get('xml')
    .then(({ confObj, rstream }) => {
      // confObj contains useful info as lastModified, expires, relatedData, ...
      rstream.pipe(res); // where 'res' is a writable stream like a HTTP response with proper XML headers
    })
    .catch(({ err, confObj, rstream }) => {
      if (err && err.code === 'EXPIRED') {
        // the data was in cache but has expired, adjust to your need
        // it could be interesting to reuse the related data or rstream
      } else {
        // no 'xml' data has been cached
      }
    });
  ```

####getSync(name)
Get all properties of the 'name' configuration object. *Synchronous*

Params:
  - name \<String\>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - confObj <Object> or {} if nothing found

Example:
  ```javascript
  const confObj = cache.getSync('xml');

  // or destructuring
  const { data, lastModified, expires } = cache.getSync('xml');
  ```

####set({ name, data, encoding = 'utf8', time = 1h, relatedData = {}, override = true })
Set data in cache, a conf file and a data file will be created. To set an image in cache set data with a binary buffer. *Asynchronous*

Params:
  - name <String>: the name of the object to cache
  - data <Object>: the data that will be saved in the data file and get via rstream
  - encoding <String> (optional): the encoding, one of those supported by Node.js, **utf8** by default
  - time <Number> (optional): the time **in milliseconds** to keep data in cache, >= 1 second and <= 365 days, **1 hour** by default.
  - relatedData <Object> (optional): the related data that may have been used to construct data, **{}** by default.
  - override <Boolean> (optional): true to override a previous object in cache, false if not. Throw 'EEXIST' error code if *override* was set to *false*. **true** by default.

Returns:
  - Promise:
    - resolve with a confirmation message <String>
    - reject with an error <Error>

Example:
  ```javascript
  cache
    .set({
      name: 'xml',
      data: '<SnowReport><Mountain name="Mont-Blanc"><TrailsOpen>9</TrailsOpen></Mountain></SnowReport>',
      relatedData: {
        'Mont-Blanc': {
          TrailsOpen: 9,
        },
      },
    })
    .then(() => {
      // object successfully set in cache
      // ...
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      // an error occurred
      // if no override was allowed we could check if an object is already in cache
      // with this condition: if (err && err.code === 'EEXIST')
    });
  ```

####setParallel(object, callback)
Same as **cache.set** method but set data in cache in parallel. A conf file and a data file will be created with streams so it is not unsafe to make multiple call to setParallel or to wait until the object has successfully been cached. *Asynchronous*

Params:
  - object <Object>: the same object as in **cache.set** method

Returns:
  - callback(err, confObj) <Function>:
    - err <Error>: an error instance, streams return 'EEXIST' error code if override is set to false and the object with the same name is already in cache
    - confObj <Object>: the configuration object saved in cache

Example:
  ```javascript
  cache.setParallel({
    name: 'xml',
    data: '<SnowReport><Mountain name="Mont-Blanc"><TrailsOpen>9</TrailsOpen></Mountain></SnowReport>',
    relatedData: {
      'Mont-Blanc': {
        TrailsOpen: 9,
      },
    },
  });

  // continue other stuff with only logs if an error occurred

  // or
  cache.setParallel({
    name: 'xml',
    data: '<SnowReport><Mountain name="Mont-Blanc"><TrailsOpen>9</TrailsOpen></Mountain></SnowReport>',
    relatedData: {
      'Mont-Blanc': {
        TrailsOpen: 9,
      },
    },
  }, (err, confObj) => {
    // if override option was false and an object in cache has the same name
    if (err && err.code === 'EEXIST') {

    }

    // if override option was true (true by default)
    if (err) {
      // log error with your logger
    } else if (confObj) {
      // object has been saved
    }
  });
  ```

####hasSync(name)
Test if data are in cache or not, taking into account expires time. *Synchronous*

Params:
  - name <String>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - <Boolean>: true if the object is in cache, false if not or has expired.

####reset(name)
Reset expire time by setting the new one running from now with the original cache time set. *Asynchronous*

Params:
  - name <String>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - Promise:
    - resolve with a confirmation message <String>
    - reject with an error <Error>

Example:
  ```javascript
  cache
    .get('xml')
    .then(({ confObj, rstream }) => {
      // confObj contains useful info as lastModified, expires, relatedData, ...
      rstream.pipe(res); // where 'res' is a writable stream like a HTTP response with proper XML headers
    })
    .catch(({ err, confObj, rstream }) => {
      if (err && err.code === 'EXPIRED') {
        // reset the object so that it can be set again in cache for the original time (in these examples time is ommit so it equals 1 hour in milliseconds)
        cache
          .reset('xml')
          .then((msg) => {
            // ...
          })
          .catch(err => debug(err));
      } else {
        // no 'xml' data has been cached
      }
    });
  ```

####resetSync(name)
Reset expire time by setting the new one running from now with the original cache time set. *Synchronous*

Params:
  - name <String>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - <Boolean>: true if reseted, false if not

####delete(name)

Params:
  - name <String>: the name of the object in cache

Returns:
  - Promise:
    - resolve with a confirmation message <String>
    - reject with an error <Error> if one of the two files is not in cache
